What is git?
Git is  a free, open-source software distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to manage all source code history.
It can keep a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code. 
Each developer must have Git installed on his or her local device to collaborate.
Git is installed locally on a system, so developers can manage their source code history using their local machines as repositories. This means there is no centralized server required to use Git, and no needed internet access either.
Additionally, there’s no user-management system available and a proprietary desktop GUI.


What is github?
Github is is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories.
With GitHub, developers can share their repositories, access other developers’ repositories, and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.
lives in the cloud, so Internet access is required. It also has a built-in user-management system and a user-friendly GUI. 
In addition to its main website, GitHub features a desktop version that can be installed on local computers to help synchronize code.
It should be noted that Git can be used without GitHub, but GitHub cannot be used without Git.
